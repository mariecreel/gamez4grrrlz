      I am the cockroach in the kitchen <br/>
      you sprayed with Raid I am the thousand <br/>
      cockroaches alive below your linoleum I <br/>
      crawl across the counter into drinks and <br/>
      ashtrays eat your scraps and trash you <br/>
      leave me no choice but to scavenge <br/>
      cabinets on late nights when you flip on lights I <br/>
      slip away wish I didn't have to hide in my own <br/>
      home to survive but I want to live— <br/>
      I’m not afraid to die but I don’t want<br/>
      to be dissected by your eyes <br/>
      once you've broken my protection
    </p> </div>
    <div class="dialogue" id ="bedroomdialog" title="Bedroom"> <p>
      This is my sanctuary. <br/>
      Paint peels from bookcase, <br/>
      vanity smeared with fingerprints,<br/>
      carpet stained with vomit:<br/>
      all the ways I mark it. <br/>
      When I want to feel safe,<br/>
      I close the door and lock it. <br/>
      Blankets block the light<br/>
      and sound that slips from reaching<br/>
      your eyes and ears. I know you stand<br/>
      outside my door and press your ear.<br/>
      Your footsteps back<br/>
      and forth along the hall track<br/>
      four hundred beats an hour. You want<br/>
      to hear something damning, like tears<br/>
      falling, sobs, skin rubbing, knives<br/>
      cutting— <br/>
      How unlucky for you I’m<br/>
      sworn to silence! And so, too, are<br/>
      the walls.

      I <em>developed</em> early. <br/>
      My outer <br/>
      petals <br/>
      unfurled before my <br/>
      stamen <br/>
      extended. I am <br/>
      always mommy when <br/>
      we play house. I know <br/>
      you don’t mean to hurt me, <br/>
      pin me with your mouth, make me  <br/>
      dirty. Still, <br/>
      I won’t forgive you. <br/>
      In the bath, you suck <br/>
      memories from my flesh, all the <br/>
      sweet ones, and spit them<br/>
      into the water before <br/>
      it all slips down the drain. <br/>
      What a waste.
    </p></div>
    <div class="dialogue" id = "closetdialog" title="Closet"> <p>
      I hide the bodies in the closet because <br/>
      my sister doesn’t want to carry <br/>
      out the dirty work of disposal. <br/>
      When I see the corpses, I feel something bad, <br/>
      an itch I can’t scratch <br/>
      parasite under my skin-- <br/>
      So I keep the bodies in the closet.<br/>
      Imagine their not-flesh, bent limbs,<br/>
      shorn heads, and tell me what<br/>
      you’d do knowing they were<br/>
      so close to your bed they<br/>
      heard your dreams. Frocks are<br/>
      not enough to hide scary bits,<br/>
      cover cracking joints, <br/>
      ball segments of hip flexors I broke<br/>
      with my hands <br/>
      just for fun. <br/>
      I fear they will retaliate,<br/>
      angry that I shoved them in plastic <br/>
      bags and<br/>
      buried them below old blankets.<br/>
      When I sleep they invade my bed<br/>
      like zealous mice, and I wake<br/>
      eye to eye with the girls I dismembered<br/>
      before I knew the word.<br/>
      But what can they do to me, really?
