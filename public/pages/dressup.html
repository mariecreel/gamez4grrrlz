      <p>Today is the day...10th grade school portraits.</p>
      <p>Last year, mom saw the proofs and she was really mad at me.
      She chewed me out and didn't buy a single picture. She
      thought it was a waste of money to buy a picture
      when I looked so 'raggedy.'</p>
      <p>She won't be awake when I leave for the bus,
      so she won't see what I'm wearing. I don't know if I should
      dress up, or if I should just
      wear what I want and toss the proofs...</p>
      <p>
        <em>(Like I could toss them...I do wish she would get one
      picture of me from after 2010 for the hallway, or her purse, or something. I really do want her
      to like the pictures...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, can you help me pick an outfit? I can't do this alone...</p>
