        <p>Today is the day...10th grade school portraits.</p>
        <p>Last year, mom saw the proofs and she was really mad at me.
        She chewed me out and didn't buy a single picture. She
        thought it was a waste of money to buy a picture
        when I looked so 'raggedy.'</p>
        <p>She won't be awake when I leave for the bus,
        so she won't see what I'm wearing. I don't know if I should
        dress up, or if I should just
        wear what I want and toss the proofs...</p>
        <p>
          <em>(Like I could toss them...I do wish she would get one
        picture of me from after 2010 for the hallway, or her purse, or something. I really do want her
        to like the pictures...)</em>
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, can you help me pick an outfit? I can't do this alone...</p>
